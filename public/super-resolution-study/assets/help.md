For each image pair, you will be asked to evaluate several aspects of image quality and diagnostic utility. Please take adequate time to examine each image pair by zooming in, zooming out, panning before providing your assessments.

Score each metric on a scale of -1, 0, 1, where:
- -1 = Left is better
- 0 = Same
- 1 = Right is better
