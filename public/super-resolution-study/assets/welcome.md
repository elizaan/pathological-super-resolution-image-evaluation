# Evaluation of Super-Resolution Technology in Cancer Pathology Image Analysis

## Introduction

Thank you for participating in this study evaluating the effectiveness of super-resolution technology in cancer pathology image analysis. This research aims to assess whether super-resolution imaging techniques improve the ability to detect and analyze cancer cells compared to traditional imaging methods.

### Instructions

You will be presented with ten pairs of cancer images side by side:
- Left: Original image
- Right: Super-resolution version of the same image

For each image pair, you will be asked to evaluate several aspects of image quality and diagnostic utility. Please take adequate time to examine each image pair by zooming in, zooming out, panning before providing your assessments.

Score each metric on a scale of -1, 0, 1, where:
- -1 = Left is better
- 0 = Same
- 1 = Right is better
